                    and he said, “Shall I not tell you of the greatest of the Quran?” The Prophet recited to him, “All
                    praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds,” (1:1) meaning Surat al-Fatihah.</p>

                    will watch the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. She laid out a
                    cushion for the Prophet ﷺ and he slept on the direction of its long side. He awoke and wiped the sleep
                    from his eyes, then recited the last ten verses of Surat Al-Imran until its end.
